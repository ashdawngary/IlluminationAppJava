Ali is a national speaker who shares her experience with embracing the gift of challenge, overcoming adversity and learning true resilience. As a sixteen year old, Ali became a volunteer firefighter and experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault, and years of bullying at the hands of her fellow firefighters. Unaware of how deeply the constant stress was affecting her, Ali began to change psychologically and emotionally until she was no longer mentally well. While struggling to pursue her passion for firefighting, Ali developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that kept her stuck in the past and kept her from engaging in life. Through working with a wonderful therapist and surrounding herself with the love and support of family and friends, Ali learned how to take her life back and live it freely. Ali was able to re-identify herself as a victor instead of a victim and loves helping people do the same.
